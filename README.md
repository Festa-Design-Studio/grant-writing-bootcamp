# Background

[Proudtobeme](https://proudtobeme.org/) (PTBM) is a nonprofit empowering young individuals (13-25) from underserved communities in the UK ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ and Nigeria ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡¬.&#x20;

PTBM relies on grant writing for fundraising to support its mission. Despite having grant writing team of 5 members, many grant submissions were unsuccessful, prompting PTBM to enhance their grant writers' skills and confidence. This led to the creation of a Grant Writing Bootcamp in partnership with Abayomi, the Founder of Festa Design Studio.

The bootcamp aims to equip PTBM's grant writers with refined skills and confidence to draft compelling proposals. By improving their grant-writing capabilities, PTBM hopes to secure more funding to empower underserved youth and expand their impact.
