#### Activities supporting (pre-bootcamp): Planning, operations and resources development for implementing grant writers bootcamp.

1. **Defining Monitoring and Evaluation (M\&E):** Establish project’s performance indicators (log frame), tracking of activities (timeline), and continuous feedback (weekly meetings). By defining the above mentioned, we ensure that activities are on track to achieve their objectives.
2. **Communication Plan:** Conduct audience research to define persona development for developing a communication strategy which includes visual identity, communication messages, design of clear and actionable calls-to-action.
3. **Defining Selection Criteria:** Establish criteria for selecting participants for the grant writing bootcamp, as well as criteria for selecting mentors who will guide the chosen participants throughout the bootcamp.
4. **Draft Call for Registration Questions for Participants:** Drafting registration questions that align with the established selection criteria to ensure a smooth selection process for evaluating the knowledge and experience of participants and mentors in grant writing.
5. **Open Call for Registrations:** Launch the call for registration (for 45 days), for participants and mentors to apply for the grant writing bootcamp online. This also includes general promotion of bootcamp and the organisation implementing it for at least 5 days before opening a call for registration.
6. **Define Bootcamp Agenda and Session Outline:** Developing a comprehensive agenda and session outline for the bootcamp. This includes determining the key topics to be covered, time allocation for each session and who is responsible. Preparing materials and resources such as presentations.
7. **Selection and Onboarding:** Selecting mentors and participants based on established criteria and conducting the onboarding process for the grant writing mentoring.

#### Activities supporting (bootcamp): Non-formal education activities in grant writing offered to grant writers.

1. **Grant Writing Bootcamp:** brings together 20 participants online for a 5-day educational event that includes grant writing processes and components, future planning and career orientation in grant writing. During the 5-day educational events, participants will be engaged in hands-on grant writing projects and practices. Participants will be provided with a wide range of grant writing key project themes that align with Proudtobeme’s program focus areas, enhancing their ability to develop relevant and impactful grant proposals. Successful participants who completed grant writing bootcamp will be offered a preliminary employment contract with Proudtobeme, to further their grant writing experience after bootcamp.
